WordPress theme boilerplate built on Zurb Foundation 6.

== Description ==
According to Greek mythology, Ariadne was the daughter of Minos, king of Crete. She helped Theseus solve the labyrinth and defeat the minotaur, and later
(after Theseus abandoned her) married the god Dionysus.

We recognise that for many, building a WordPress theme feels like a maze. This boilerplate follows Ariadne's example in trying to untangle and simplify 
that process. It is not intended as a final theme in its own right, but rather as a starting point which provides much of the base functionality required.

As of version 2, it is strongly recommended that you do not edit the theme directly, but instead use a child theme to extend it. Doing so will allow you
to update the base theme to get access to new features and bug fixes, without having to reapply your customisations. Alternately you are of course welcome
to fork the theme and create your own version - as long as you are aware that you'll have to manually backport any future changes.

To make the best use of this boilerplate, pair it with Gravity Forms and Advanced Custom Fields Pro.
